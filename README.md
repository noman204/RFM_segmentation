RFM Segmentation: Analyzing Sales Data for Customer Insights
Mysql,Excel,mysqlworkbench
I recently utilized SQL to analyze a sales dataset, unveiling key insights:

1️⃣ Sales Overview: Examined total revenue per year and detected trends in product lines.

2️⃣ Best Sales Month: November 2004 showed the highest sales, driven by Classic Cars.

3️⃣ RFM Analysis: Employed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to segment customers based on transaction behavior, identifying groups like "Loyal" and "Active."

4️⃣ Customer Segmentation: Categorized customers into segments like "Churned Customers" and "New Customers" based on RFM scores.
